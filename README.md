## YouNameIt!

Welcome to **YouNameIt!**, a project helping people with aphasia practice their word retrieval skill and assisting them to remember words on a daily basis.

Our backbone is a prefix-tuned FLAN-T5 large for predicting the word the user is looking for based on a given description. 
In this repository, you find all relevant files for training our reverse dictionary as well as first approaches for using Llama 2 as conversational module.
